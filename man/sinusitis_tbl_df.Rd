The dataset name has been changed to 'sinusitis_tbl_df' to avoid confusion with other datasets from
packages in the R ecosystem and to follow the naming conventions of the 'MedDataSets' package.
The suffix '_tbl_df' indicates that this dataset is a tibble, helping to distinguish it from
other datasets within the package and from those in the broader R ecosystem. The original content
of the dataset has not been modified in any way.
