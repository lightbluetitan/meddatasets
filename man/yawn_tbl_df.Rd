\title{Contagiousness of Yawning}
\format{
A tibble with 50 observations and 2 variables:
\describe{
  \item{result}{A factor indicating the result of the yawning observation (e.g., yawned, did not yawn).}
  \item{group}{A factor representing the group to which the participants belong (e.g., control, experimental).}
}
}
\source{
Data collected from a study on yawning contagion.
}
\usage{
data(yawn_tbl_df)
}
\description{
The dataset name has been changed to 'yawn_tbl_df' to avoid confusion with other datasets from
packages in the R ecosystem and to follow the naming conventions of the 'MedDataSets' package.
The suffix '_tbl_df' indicates that this dataset is a tibble, helping to distinguish it from
other datasets within the package and from those in the broader R ecosystem. The original content
of the dataset has not been modified in any way.
}
\details{
This dataset investigates the contagiousness of yawning. It includes results from an experiment that
examines whether individuals yawn more when they are in the presence of someone else who is yawning,
providing insights into social behaviors and contagion phenomena.
