The dataset name has been changed to 'transplant_tbl_df' to avoid confusion with other datasets from

The suffix '_tbl_df' indicates that this dataset is a tibble, helping to distinguish it from
other datasets within the package and from those in the broader R ecosystem. The original content
of the dataset has not been modified in any way.
